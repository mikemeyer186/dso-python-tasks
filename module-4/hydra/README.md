# My `hydra` tool

This folder contains the source code for my own implementation of the `hydra` tool.
Hydra can be used to attack hosts by forcing the password for a known user.

This is a lightweight implementation that covers the following features/options:

-   Dictionary attack with a wordlist
-   Bruteforce attack with a defined characterset

## Getting started

## Usage examples
